    question: 'What is Anoryx Intelligence Infrastructure?',
    primary:
      'Anoryx Intelligence Infrastructure is the unified technology layer that powers our multi-product ecosystem: AI-driven software systems, privacy protection platforms, and autonomous digital workflows. It combines scalable cloud-native architecture, secure data pipelines, and research-led engineering to deliver enterprise-grade intelligence across PII Sentinel, B4LABS, and Rendly.',
    secondary:
      'The infrastructure is designed for long-term relevance—emphasizing privacy-first engineering, system-level thinking, and integration with existing enterprise environments rather than isolated point solutions.',
    knowMoreLink: null,
  },
  {
    id: 'autonomous-execution',
    question: 'How does autonomous execution work within enterprise environments?',
    primary:
      'Autonomous execution within Anoryx is delivered through AI agents and multi-agent workflows that sense enterprise signals, make decisions, and execute actions across infrastructure without constant human intervention. The system uses LLM integration, workflow orchestration, and continuous feedback to operate within governance and security constraints.',
    secondary:
      'Execution is designed to coordinate across cloud systems, internal infrastructure, and enterprise platforms while maintaining compliance and auditability.',
    knowMoreLink: null,
  },
  {
    id: 'integration',
    question: 'How does Anoryx integrate with existing enterprise systems?',
    primary:
      'Anoryx systems integrate via API ecosystems, microservices interfaces, and cloud-native architectures. Our platforms are built for deployment into existing enterprise environments—supporting secure data pipelines, standardized compliance hooks, and scalable backend integration without requiring full rip-and-replace.',

    knowMoreLink: '/platform/architecture',
  },
  {
    id: 'security-trust',
    question: 'How is enterprise security and trust enforced?',
    primary:
      'Security and trust are enforced through privacy-first engineering, intelligent PII detection and protection, compliance automation, and cryptography-backed data processing. Enterprise data is treated as sensitive infrastructure—with controlled access, audit trails, and alignment to global and regional compliance frameworks.',
    secondary:
      'Our approach combines automated compliance intelligence with human oversight and transparent governance so enterprises can innovate without compromising trust.',
    knowMoreLink: '/platform/security-trust',
  },
  {
    id: 'differentiation',
    question: 'What makes Anoryx different from traditional AI platforms?',
    primary:
      'Anoryx integrates AI, data privacy, blockchain, and autonomous workflows into a single cohesive ecosystem rather than offering AI or security in isolation. We focus on research-driven innovation, long-term system thinking, and product-led growth—building technology that remains relevant at scale.',
    secondary:
      'Differentiation comes from combining intelligence, trust, and autonomy in one stack—addressing data protection, intelligent automation, and digital identity together.',
    knowMoreLink: null,
  },
  {
    id: 'continuous-improvement',
    question: 'How does the platform continuously improve and learn?',
    primary:
      'The platform improves through B4LABS as the internal innovation engine—converting proof-of-concepts into production-ready AI frameworks, reusable agent modules, and workflow intelligence. Operational feedback, research experimentation, and continuous optimization are built into the architecture.',
    secondary:
      'Learning is applied across products: PII Sentinel benefits from improved detection models, while Rendly and enterprise workflows benefit from evolving AI capabilities.',
